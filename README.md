# SparkStreaming
This is the scala code for Spark streaming tasks.<br>

Task 1: Count the word frequency and save the output in HDFS
Task 2: filter out the short words (i.e., < 5characters) and then count the co-occurrence frequency of words (the words are considered co-occurred if they are in the same line); save the output in HDFS.
Task 3: count the co-occurrence frequency of words. Use updateStateByKey operation to continuously update the co-occurrence frequency of words with new information
